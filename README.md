TOF separation power = f(pT,y) for HL-LHC experiments

Abstract :

    The document addresses comparative performances expected for various configurations of Time-Of-Flight detectors,
    for several CERN experiments (ALICE-1, ALICE-3, ATLAS, CMS).
    The figures are based on analytical formulae derived for charged particles travelling in a solenoidal magnetic field.
    While these performances correspond to ideal limits 
    (with respect to real data or full simulations including particle transport),
    the main point is to assess the theoretical separation among various identified species 
    (e±, µ±, π±, K±, p±, d±, t±, 3He±, 4He±)
    at the horizon of runs IV (~2027-2029) or V (> 2030) of the High-Luminosity LHC, HL-LHC.
    The intent is thus to appreciate the experimental realm of possible physics cases.
